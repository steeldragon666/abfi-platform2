## Analysis of Options

### Option A: Corporate Enterprise

This design exudes a sense of professionalism, stability, and trust. The navy and gold color scheme, combined with serif typography and formal layout, is well-suited for a conservative corporate audience. The prominent display of client logos from major financial institutions and security certifications effectively builds credibility with risk-averse decision-makers.

### Option B: Modern Minimalist Tech

This option presents a cutting-edge, innovative image for the ABFI Platform. The vibrant emerald green, geometric typography, and abstract imagery appeal to a tech-savvy audience of developers and startups. The focus on API endpoints and developer tools in the features section directly addresses the needs of this target group. The minimalist design and use of whitespace create a clean, modern aesthetic.

### Option C: Government/Institutional

Designed for the public sector, this mockup prioritizes accessibility, clarity, and trustworthiness. The use of the Australian Government's color palette and crests immediately establishes a connection with this audience. The layout is structured and easy to navigate, adhering to high accessibility standards (WCAG AAA). The imagery of Australian landmarks and infrastructure reinforces the focus on public-sector projects.
